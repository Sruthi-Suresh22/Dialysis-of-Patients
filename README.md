## Project Description

The Health Care Dialysis industry is a complex sector that operates globally, encompassing various treatment methods including hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. It is a dynamic industry influenced by various factors, requiring adaptability, strategic planning, and a commitment to patient safety and satisfaction for long-term success. Analyzing the data of the dialysis industry serves as a fundamental tool for improving efficiency and making informed decisions. This analysis includes assessing the number of centers, patient volumes, profit vs. non-profit entities, category comparisons, and payment reduction rates. By analysing these factors, healthcare institutions can enhance treatment infrastructure and ultimately improve patient care in the dialysis sector.

## Insights

### KPI-1 : Number of Patients across various summaries

- This KPI provides insights into the demand for dialysis services and assists healthcare providers in delivering personalized care.
- It emphasizes the importance of prioritizing resources and interventions based on the frequency and health impact of each summary type.

### KPI-2 : Profit Vs Non-Profit Stats

- Comparing the financial performance is an important aspect which is required to understand the economic landscape of the health care sector.
- This analysis helps in identifying the differences in financial outcomes between profit and non-profit organizations and enables the stakeholders to take informed decisions regarding resource allocation, cost management and sustainability of care.

### KPI-3 : Chain Organizations w.r.t. Total Performance Score as No Score

- Assessing chain organizations based on the total performance score is a significant KPI in healthcare analytics.
- By analyzing this KPI ,healthcare providers can identify the areas of improvement and provide quality care delivery across different chains.

### KPI-4 : Dialysis Stations Stats

- The number of Dialysis Stations varies across Countries, States and Cities.
- Country-wise, the highest number of dialysis stations is located in Los Angeles (4,129) followed by Harris (2,499) and Cook (2,365).
- State-wise, the highest number of dialysis stations is located in California (15,095) folowed by Texas (14,200) and Florida (8,838).
- City-wise, the highest numberof dialysis stations is located in Houston (1,972) followed by Chicago (1,329) and San Antonio (1,165).
- This variation is likely due to number of factors, including population density, the prevalance of Kidney disease, and the availability of healthcare resources.

### KPI-5 : No. of Category Text  - As Expected

- Patient Hospitalization Category tops the highestnumber of "As Expected" results (6,818) followed by Patient Hospital Re-admission Category text (6,714) and PPPW Category text (6,659).
- This suggests that these category must be well understood or predictable in terms of outcomes.

### KPI-6 : Average Payment Reduction Rate

- Average Payment Reduction rate calculates and tracks the average rate at which payments are reduced, providing insights to cost-saving measures.
- The analysis of this KPI helps the healthcare providers in assessing the financial performance, identifying the factors cnotributing to payment reduction.

## Conclusion

- The total number of patients across various summaries amounted to 22.32 million.
- The "Serum Phosphorous Summary" has the highest number of patients.
- There are 369 Chain Organizations with total performance score as "No Score".
- The total number of Dialysis stations is 135K. Los Angeles tops among the countries, California among the states and Houston among the cities.
- The overall profit reached 89%, with Los Angeles contributing the highest.

This dashboard helps the Healthcare Organizations in understanding the healthcare data to draw insights for making informed decisions for providing better care and improving the overall well-being of the patients.
